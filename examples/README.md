# Examples

Run both examples under `cargo warden` using the helper script:

```bash
./run_examples.sh
```

Expected output includes messages such as:

```text
== network-build ==
warning: network blocked: Operation not permitted (os error 1)

== spawn-bash ==
spawn blocked: Permission denied (os error 1)
```
