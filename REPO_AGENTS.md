# Repository Agent Instructions

- These instructions are mandatory for every task in this repository.
- Use avatars from the MCP server at `https://qqrm.github.io/avatars-mcp/` for all work.
- Before starting work, review `SPEC.md` to choose the next task.
- Run `./repo-setup.sh` to configure the workspace (this installs actionlint, ensures libseccomp is available, and synchronizes git remotes). Keep all repository initialization commands inside `repo-setup.sh`; do not create additional local setup scripts.
