# Repository Agent Instructions

- These instructions are mandatory for every task in this repository.
- Use avatars from the MCP server at `https://qqrm.github.io/avatars-mcp/` for all work.
- Before starting work, review `SPEC.md` to choose the next task.
- Run `./local_setup.sh` to install `actionlint` for linting GitHub workflows.
- Ensure the system package `libseccomp-dev` is installed locally (run `apt-get update` followed by `apt-get install -y libseccomp-dev` when missing) so sandbox builds succeed.
